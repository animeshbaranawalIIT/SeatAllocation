</li><li> Please write (only if true) the honor
  code. If you used any source (person or thing) explicitly state
  it. You can find the honor code on the web page.

<h2>The Tasks</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ol type="1">
<li> The purpose of this task is to improve your coding experience
  building upon on what you did in CS101 and CS154. In particular, we
  will take a industry-robust piece of software, learn how to build a
  library using the command line, and understand some parts of the
  source code.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  Later on you will use this software to create your course project.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  <b>Recall that you will be doing this in your own group only,
    and not seek help across groups.</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  
<ol type="a">
<li> Download the pre-packaged Box2D code from the lab03 assignment
    directory.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> (Nothing to submit) Follow the instructions in
    Instructions.txt carefully.  I cannot overemphasize this part:
    "carefully".  At the end of this you should be able to get this
    picture

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    
<center>    <img src="./Lab 03_files/box2d.png" alt="images/box2d.png">        
    </center>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> (To Submit) On our computer the box on the right starts on the inclined
    plane, and continues to stay on the inclined plane after the
    simulation, i.e., even when t &#8594; &#8734;. We want this box 
    to be annoyed, and  chase the sphere that caused it to
    move. Change the code <em>minimally</em> so that this happens. See
    below for interpretation of minimal.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>   Canceled.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> (Extra credit, karma points): Does the box catch up with the
    sphere in a short period of time?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> (Not optional, but not to be submitted). Do this before
    lab04. Link your lab2 to lab3 on your <tt>public_html</tt> page.  I
    want the ability to get to what you have done in the viva.  Also
    place a screen shot of your output in this lab.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> What to submit and how we will score you.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
   For this assignment, we want to continue to teach you how to be
   parsimonious.  Therefore, we will be extra careful, and we will
   deduct points if you submit anything that we don't care for. In
   particular, we do not want you to submit anything that we cannot
   generate by ourselves.  Furthermore, we discussed
   <b>"obfuscation"</b> in 
   the class. We do not care for obfuscation, so please do not change
   the layout of the given programs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
   We cannot imagine how you made the box chase the ball. So attach to
   your submission the source code <tt>.cpp</tt> file(s) that contains the
   minimal change(s). In particular, do not attach Box2D, or any
   executable, or any other files that did not change.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
   Scoring: In this lab, we will assume that you are perfect, and count 
   down from 100. Every time you do something poorly or incorrectly, we
   will start deducting marks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
   
<ul>
<li> First, we will look at the semantic content of the
     submission, i.e., the change. We will re-compile
     the program and run to see the changes. If it does what it is supposed
     to do, you will remain at the score in the previous step
     (100). If, on the other hand, it does something weird, we will
     deduct up to 60 marks.  If it does nothing different from what we
     have given you, then your marks will be set to zero.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     So you could be 100, 40, or 0 at this point. If you get zero,
     (you have not done anything in this assignment) we will not
     continue to check the assignment, i.e., we won't follow the steps
     below.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>  Next, we will do a syntactic check of your
     submission. If you sent anything extra, you will lose a hefty
     50% of the marks. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     At this point you have either 100, 50, 40, or 20. (We don't mention zero
     because we won't be doing this step if you are zero.)
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>   <tt>%&nbsp;diff&nbsp;origfile.cpp&nbsp;submittedfile.cpp</tt>
     

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     The above  part is scrapped.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Finally, we switch back to semantics only if you have 40 or
     more marks.  We will continue to look at <b>how</b> you
     achieved your change.  If the change is close to optimal, you
     will retain your high marks.  Otherwise you will lose  5 more
     marks.  We will be surprisingly liberal in the definition of
     minimal change but once we decide that your solution is ugly, we
     <em>will</em> deduct 5 marks.  Generally we do not expect this
     deduction. Generally speaking, we expect the solution to be
     unduly artificial, i.e., we don't want something you would not do
     in real life.  Keep in mind the use of the word "chase" in the description of this task.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    At this point you can figure out what marks you might have :)
<div class="p"><!----></div>
