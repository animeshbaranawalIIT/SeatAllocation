<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The purpose of this task is to improve your coding experience
  building upon on what you did in CS101 and CS154. In particular, we
  will take a industry-robust piece of software, learn how to build a
  library using the command line, and understand some parts of the
  source code.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  Later on you will use this software to create your course project.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  
<ol type="1">
<li> (Nothing to submit on Moodle) Download the pre-packaged Box2D code from the lab03 assignment
    directory.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> (Nothing to submit on Moodle) Follow the instructions in
    Instructions.txt carefully.  I cannot overemphasize this part:
    "carefully".  At the end of this you should be able to get this
    picture

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    
<center>    <img src="./In-Lab 03_files/box2d.png" alt="images/box2d.png">        
    </center>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> (Action needed).  Show "your" TA the working action of your setup.
    Go to the Moodle quiz, answer Q1 by getting your TA to write his
    name. By placing his name, he is certifying that he has verified
    that you have got Box2D running, and you have got the given
    simulation going.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    Also write in the quiz the answer to this question: Does the
    square box on the extreme right stays in the see-saw as t &#8594; &#8734;?  ( Write in complete sentence the answer to
    the above question. Don't just write Yes or No).
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> (No submission).  Observe that the simulation succeeds in
    "flipping" the square box on the right in the air. However, the
    simulation takes too much time. Record the time taken to the
    nearest second.  Using the GUI controls change the 
    settings so that the "flip" happens approximately 50%
    sooner. Also play with other settings and record your observations.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> (Action needed).  On Moodle, write down the answer to the
    following pieces  of information.
    
<ol type="a">
<li> How much time did the flip take at the start?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> How much time did the flip take after you changed the
      settings?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> What settings did you change? (Write both initial and
      final).
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> (Optional) What other observations did you have on changing
      the settings?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    Use complete sentences to write the answers, don't just write "23
    seconds".  Use the best possible unit, so don't write the answer
    in milliseconds if it is not useful.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> (No submission).  Observe that the flip happens after several
    "spheres" drop in the left pulley basket.  You now want the flip
    to happen when only one ball drops into the left pulley basket.
    Manipulate the source code in a minimal way to achieve this.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> (Action needed). On Moodle, write down the changes you made to
    achieve the "one sphere causing flip". You can copy paste the
    relevant code, but have two sections: "Before" and "After".
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>
