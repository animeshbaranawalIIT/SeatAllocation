<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Before I start, let's get over the submission guidelines and the
general principles in doing an assignment. 

<ol type="1">
<li> First, my belief is that you learn best when you do things, 
  yourself.  You also learn when you do things in a group, but it
becomes hard for me to give marks to figure out who has done what.
So as a compromise, please work within the group, and not across a
group.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> When you submit, please document individual percentages such as
  Student 1: 80%, Student 2:100%, Student 3:10%.  In this example,
  the second student will get full marks (10/10) and the first student
  will receive 8/10.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> When you submit your assignment, you expect me to do a fair
evaluation.  This is usually difficult - For about 100 students, you might
want to calculate the amount of time I have to spend, EVEN if I spend
only 10% of the time you spent on it. For example, you might have
spent about 180 minutes on this assignment (including reading this
part :)  So the best way of submitting an assignment is to follow the
instructions VERY VERY carefully - the same way you probably filled out your
JEE form.  Any mistakes - of any kind - clerical,
typographical,  will attract penalties (i.e., reduced marks).
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> You are going to create a web page that documents your work in
  this task. However, <em>don't make it public</em>.  Submit it on
  moodle as a rollnumber.tgz (preferred) or .zip file (no .rar please,
  and no email please).  Use the ASC format for your roll number
  (i.e., with leading zero if applicable). Be sure to note that moodle
  does not have infinite size, so prune your submission. DO NOT SEND
  JUNK FILES THAT ARE IRRELEVANT IN THE ASSIGNMENT (mac users
  especially to note).  Any links within
  the web page should be to a local file - not absolute links.  Also
  tgz the entire contents, but do not include any binary files.  Do
  include makefiles, where 
  appropriate, to make my task easy. Do include a readme.txt (telling
  me whatever you want to tell me), and the honor code.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<h2>The Tasks</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ol type="1">
<li> The purpose of this task is to able to present your work on a
  web page.  You might have seen a gazillion web pages; wait, we are not
  going to make a super duper page.  We will do just enough to get the
  basics of a web page.  A modern web page has these principal
  components: CSS, Images, Javascript, and Forms.  We won't do forms yet but
  we will do other stuff.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  
<ol type="a">
<li> Basic Web page stub:   This page will have the following
    components 
    
<ul>
<li> The landing page will be a template for all things to come.
      It is essential that you also place links to your lab group and
      a link to the forcoming lab 02.  See this example. This page
      will be named index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      
<center>      <img src="./Lab 01_files/index.png" alt="images/index.png">        
      </center>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> The next page will be an "about me" page. It will
      introduce who your are, where are you 
      from, what are you doing at IITB, anything you want to say about
      yourself. Name this page aboutMe.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      
<center>      <img src="./Lab 01_files/aboutMe.png" alt="images/aboutMe.png">        
      </center>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Make another page called group.html where put the details
      (i.e., name and roll number) of you group members. Also, put a
      picture of each group member. Clicking on the image must open
      <s> their personal webpages </s> (this will come later -- right now, it will point to a placeholder link such as person2.html). This page, i.e., group.html has to
      be the same for the group.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> After you get the basics working, simply move your entire
      directory (folder) to another folder.  Does everything work as
      well? If not, rework the links.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    How we will score you: This section has 30 marks.  
    
<ul>
<li> Moving the folder should not result in any error. If it
      does, you get a zero here.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Your pages must contain and use sensibly at least the
      following html tags
    
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;,&lt;body&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;ul&gt;,&lt;ol&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;img&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;a&nbsp;href&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</pre>
    Feel free to use more.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> CSS: A basic guideline is to separate content and form.  The
    markup language tells us the browser what to write, and also how
    to mark them up, i.e., display.  The Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is the
    preferred way to decorate a page. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    Learn to style the html elements
    by using inline styling, included style blocks in the same html
    file and separate style file. Style one html element each a)
    inline, b) using a style block within in the html file and c)
    using a separate CSS style file. The style file must be
    called index.css. Use the same stylesheet for all webpages in this
    task. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    How we will score you: This section has 30 marks
    
<ul>
<li> We want you to localize the style elements should be
      confined to the aboutMe.html page so that it is easier for us to
      grade.  <s> Do not decorate other pages, otherwise we will give you
      zero marks for this part. </s> <strong>Changed to </strong> Only this page will be checked for decorations. 
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>  10 each for the three parts mentioned above.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Javascript: A web page like the one you have so far is pretty
    static. We want to be able to interact with the web page. One way
    of doing this is using Javascript.  This is a long topic but we
    want to do the real basics. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    (a) Create a new page called contactMe.html.  Introduce the
    <tt>&lt;script&gt;</tt> tag to enable javascript, and create a "button"
    element. If you click the button, your coordinates should be
    revealed to the users.  Feel free to place whatever little or
    large information here, we won't worry about the content.
    However, on clicking the button again, the contact information
    should disappear. Your code should be in a file called
    <tt>index.js</tt> and contain a function called <tt>toggle()</tt>.
    There might be a variety of ways of making this feature happen, we
    have used <tt>style.display&nbsp;==&nbsp;none</tt> to disable display unless
    clicked. See this picture.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      
<center>      <img src="./Lab 01_files/contactMe.png" alt="images/contactMe.png">        
      </center>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    (b) What sets your HTML page apart from one that might be made in a
    typical HTML shop?  Mathematics. Use the MathJax library to make
    beautiful math.  I am especially interested in learning from you
    what you consider interesting mathematics formula. How does a
    casio calculator figure out sin<sup>&#8722;1</sup> 23?  Write 3-4 formula that
    you love, be it physics, chemistry or mathematics or ...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
    How we will score you: This section has 40 marks.  Try to be
    creative in your math formula.  If you use the same math formula
    as some other group, then something is wrong? Maybe?.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Final notes.   This task is intended to be straight forward.  Don't
spend hours on it, unless you like to. Doing what is mentioned will
earn you 100%.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That said, do try to be creative, esp. in the content.  We won't give
you extra points but we will enjoy knowing you.  When you include,
make sure that it works in different browsers, and on different
monitor resolutions (many people in cyber cafes have 800x600
resolution monitors). 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And finally, we are sure you can get 100% marks for this. Don't
disappoint us.
