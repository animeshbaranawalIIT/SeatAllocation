TEST CASES DESCRIPTION

Test cases for the cases from 1 to 11 have been provided in the folder name corresponding to their index.


Note:

1. All the test cases have been created by modifying the sample test case provided by the instructor.

2.Some of the testcases are same because they verify multiple conditions. For example:
	The test case of index 11 and index 6 is the same because the output corresponding to this test case consists of a DS candidate occupying seat of a General candidate and also consists of a General candidate occupying seat of an OBC-PD candidate.
