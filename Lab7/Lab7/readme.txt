Downloading data
         First we downloaded the data from sir’s    
          folder using the scipt   “Download.sh”

Hierarchy structure of directory
	Individual -> bonds , international, stocks

using this hierarchy structure we created average “bonds.txt”, “international.txt”, “stocks.txt” for storing the average of the companies and stored the names in “file.txt”

We created Overall.txt which has four columns that are avg_bonds, avg_international, avg_stocks,  company name in this order

         What we have done
